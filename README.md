this is how GUI pages look:

<img width="439" height="371" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f64b2c1-0498-4eab-beaf-8643f1ef58be" />
<img width="440" height="371" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b078edf-4601-4e77-9685-70bfa66fde49" />

and this is how it looks when we apply inputs:

<img width="437" height="367" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d5f4197-a941-4c66-abcd-6e5fab1ad721" />

the page color will change according to your bmi status (obese, overweight, normal weight, underweight)
